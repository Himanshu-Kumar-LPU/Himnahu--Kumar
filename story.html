        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          Every family has a story — and ours is filled with love, laughter, and unforgettable memories.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our journey began in a small Village Bodhi bigha (Nawada) where our roots run deep. Over the years, we have grown stronger together through shared traditions, warm celebrations, and supporting each other in every phase of life.
        </p>
        <p>
          From morning chai talks to festive gatherings, we’ve built a bond that keeps us connected, no matter where life takes us.
        </p>
        <p>
          This website is a way to preserve those memories and celebrate our legacy as a family. Whether you're near or far, you're always a part of our story.
